# Supervised Learning

# What is Machine Learning
> Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being specifically programmed.

This is done by implementing special algorithms that have the ability to detect patterns in data. From a developer point of view, this means creating a system that has access to relevant data, is able to feed the data to machine learning algorithms, and is able to take the output and redirect it to downstream processes and tasks.

Supervised learning Supervised learning happens when you pass both the input and the desired outputs to the system, and you want the resulting machine learning model to capture the relationship. Supervised learning is again divided into two subsections based on the type of the labels.
