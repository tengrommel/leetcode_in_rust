- 1、Two Sum

        Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

        You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

- 2、Add Two Numbers

        You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

        You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

- 3、Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

        Given a string, find the length of the longest substrig without repeating chartacters

- 4、median of two sorted arrays
        
        There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
        Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m+n))
